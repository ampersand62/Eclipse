#1)	INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Go to http://www.snamretegas.it/en/services/Thermal_Year_2011_2012/Gas_transportation/Storage_operational_data/index.html
2) We want to download both the stogit and edison stocagio excel sheets.
3) From them we want the data for yesterday's month, as well as last month.
4) We want the day, the daily flow (mwh) and stock level (mwh) data from both the spreadsheets. Date should be in format YYYY-mm-dd. Get rid of commas in the number fields.
5) Load the data into 1 array. (date,operator,flow,stock_level).
