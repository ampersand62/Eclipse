#1)	INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Go to http://search.customs.go.th:8090/Customs-Eng/Statistic/Statistic.jsp?menuNme=Statistic
2) Click on "Import - Export Statistics from January 2007 to Current"
3) Check "HS Code". Use code: 27111100000. Check "Import"
4) We want to download the data from the last 3 months, so maybe have a loop for each month.
5) In the resulting table,we want the data in the left hand side of the table (for the month we searched for). We want the month
and year from the header to make the date in yyyy-mm-01 format,the country , quantity and CIF Value(Baht) columns. No
need for the total row at the bottom.
6) So the final array should look like: (date,country,quantity,value)
