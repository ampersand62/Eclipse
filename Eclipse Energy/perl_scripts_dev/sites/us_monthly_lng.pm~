1) Go to http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/gasregulation/publications/
2) At the bottom of the page, there is a link called "2011 - MONTHLY REPORT - NOVEMBER [127 KB PDF] [Excel Version]". It will change with month and year. Click the "Excel version".
3) In the excel file, click on LNG imports tab. We want all 3 tables. The first 2 tables can go in one array but can be distinguished by a flag called "short_long_term". All the rows in the first table should have "short term" in the "short_long_term" field and the second table should have "long term".
4) Also notice the smiley faces at the end which seem to be encoded as "J". We should have another column called "spot". If there is a smiley face in that particular row, then the column spot should have a value "yes" for that row. If there is no smily face, then have "no".
5) For the last table (puerto rico imports), there doesn't need to be a value for "short_long_term".
6) Again, dates should be in format YYYY-MM-01.
