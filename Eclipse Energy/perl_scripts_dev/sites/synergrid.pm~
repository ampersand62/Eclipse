1) Go to http://www.synergrid.be/index.cfm?PageID=18214
2) Select the download starting with "Overbrenging naar de eindklanten (maandelijkse gegevens)". The one that you choose is
the one for the current year. If we are in the first 3 months of the year, then we should try to download the current years data and iF that is not available, then download the previous years file.
3) From the file, we want the month in the first colum to be converted to a date format. I.e. YYYY-MM-01. You can use the hash %alt_french_months from misc.pm to convert french months to numbers.
4) We also want the data in columns 2-4 including the headings which should be the "type" in the final array.
Substitute the decimals with nothing (they are thousand separators) and substitue the commas for decimals in the percentages.
5) So the final array should look like: (date,type,value,percentage).
