#1)	INSTRUCTIONS:
	1) Go to the URL
	2) There is one year field and 2 month fields. 
	Set both the month fields to last month and the month before (based on todays date). They dont always have data for last month but worth trying anyway.
	3) Click search.We want everything in the country and quanitity2 columns. So the final array should look like: (date,country,quantity).
